AA0
AA10	  AA10 (formerly CBM33) proteins are copper-dependent lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs); some proteins have been shown to act on chitin, others on cellulose; lytic cellulose monooxygenase (C1-hydroxylating) (EC 1.14.99.54); lytic cellulose monooxygenase (C4-dehydrogenating)(EC 1.14.99.56); lytic chitin monooxygenase (EC 1.14.99.53)
AA11	  AA11 proteins are copper-dependent lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs); cleavage of chitin chains with oxidation of C-1 has been demonstrated for a AA11 LPMO from Aspergillus oryzae;
AA12	  The pyrroloquinoline quinone-dependent oxidoreductase activity was demonstrated for the CC1G_09525 protein of Coprinopsis cinerea.
